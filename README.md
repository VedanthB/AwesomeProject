# AwesomeProject

my first react native project



What I learned
- what is React Native, and what problem is it solving?
- the difference between Expo and plain React Native
- how to debug
- a blazing fast intro to React
- how to style components with StyleSheet and without
- component-based architecture of a React Native application
- how to display lists - FlatList and SectionList
- what navigation options are available for React Native
- [RN] how to install native modules
- react hooks - useState, useEffect, useCallback
- fetch data from network requests
- pull to refresh
- launching modals
- how to build forms
- Where to next

Some topics I might want to look into :

- Animations : check out the Animated API for pure native animations and Lottie (a React Native animation library from Airbnb) for pre-made animations
- Images: the built in Image component in React Native is not great, so check out react-native-fast-image
- Bottom tab navigator: most every app has one, but we ran out of time and features. Check out the docs on how to add one here
- useMemo: it's another React hook and a handy one. I use it a lot. Handy for memoising things. Read more about it here

Advanced topics

If you're serious about building your own app, here are some more advanced tools and libraries you might want to check out:

- CodePush: a tool that all allows you to do over the air updates to your deployed app (kind of how the Expo app works, but you'll be in charge!)
- Detox: an end to end testing framework for React Native
- react-native-testing-library: unit testing library for React Native
- Fastlane: a tool for automating building and releasing your apps
